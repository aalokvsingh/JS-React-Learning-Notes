# 📚 JS-React-Learning-Notes

A dedicated, version-controlled repository containing comprehensive notes, theoretical deep dives, and practical code snippets for mastering **JavaScript** and **React**.

This repository is structured to facilitate learning, easy review, and quick lookup of key syntax and advanced concepts. It serves as a living document of my journey through front-end development.

## 🧭 Repository Structure

The content is strictly organized by domain to ensure maintainability and quick navigation:

* **`javascript/`**: Core JavaScript concepts, from fundamental ES6 features (scope, promises) to advanced topics (prototypal inheritance, event loop).
* **`react/`**: Comprehensive guides on modern React development, including functional components, Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`), component patterns, and performance optimizations.
* **`mini-projects/`**: Small, self-contained code examples demonstrating specific concepts (e.g., a custom hook, a state management pattern).
* **`tooling/`**: Notes on essential related tools like **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**.

## 🚀 Key Learning Areas Covered

* **Modern JS:** Async/Await, Closures, `map`/`filter`/`reduce`, and the Event Loop.
* **React Hooks:** Deep understanding of dependency arrays, custom hook creation, and state management.
* **Architecture:** Component separation, performance optimization using `useCallback` and `useMemo`.
